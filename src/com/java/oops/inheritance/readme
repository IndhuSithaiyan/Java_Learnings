Multiple inheritance:

public class A {..........}
public class B {..........}
public class C extends A, B {..........}    //Java does not support multiple Inheritance

A very important fact to remember is that Java does not support multiple inheritance. This means that a class cannot extend more than one class.

Therefore following is illegal âˆ’
Example
public class extends Animal, Mammal{}

However, a class can implement one or more interfaces,
which has helped Java get rid of the impossibility of multiple inheritance.


Hybrid inheritance:
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than two types of inheritances single and multiple.
It can be achieved through interfaces only as multiple inheritance is not supported by Java.
It is basically the combination of simple, multiple, hierarchical inheritances.

public class A {..........}
public class B extends A {..........}
public class C extends A {..........}
public class D extends B, C {..........}    //Java does not support multiple Inheritance
