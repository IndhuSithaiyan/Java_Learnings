Uses of Interfaces in Java are mentioned below:

It is used to achieve total abstraction.
Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
Any class can extend only 1 class, but can any class implement an infinite number of interfaces.
It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
Interfaces are used to implement abstraction.

why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?

The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public, and static.

- In Interface only one specifier is used- Public.
- The interface cannot contain concrete (with implementation) methods.
- Interface abstract methods cannot have body
- In an interface, you canâ€™t instantiate variables and create an object.
