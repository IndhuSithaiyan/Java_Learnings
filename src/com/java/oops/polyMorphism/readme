polymorphism
poly - many
morphism - ways to represent
Act of representing the same thing in multiple ways

types:
1. CompileTime/static polymorphism - Achieved via method overloading
Method overloading - when a class has multiple methods with the same name but type, arguments, return types can be different
Method name should be same. we can differ the arguments number & return types.
example: multiple constructor
2. RunTime/Dynamic polymorphism - Achieved via method overriding
Method overriding - when a child class with the method name has the same as the parent class but body can be different
Method name should be same. we can differ by the objects which is calling the method

Parent obj = new Child();
// here reference is created for parent but the object is refers to Child class
// here if any overridden method is there than that will be executed
which method will be called depends on the object(which is with new keyword right hand side). This is known as upcasting.
