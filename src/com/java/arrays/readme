what is Array
--------------
An Array is a collection of the data types either it can be primitives or objects or even complex data types
whatever you want to store you can store it in an Array

syntax
datatype[] var_name = new dataType[size]
int[] num = new int[5]

or directly
int[] num = {1,2,3,45}

Stack Memory
primitive(like int, char, bool, float...) & reference variables are store in stack
compile time(static or fixed memory allocation)

Heap Memory
Objects(like String, your own object class...) are stores in heap
Run time(dynamic memory allocation)
