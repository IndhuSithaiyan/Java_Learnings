The LinkedHashMap Class is just like HashMap with an additional feature of maintaining an order of elements inserted into it.
HashMap provided the advantage of quick insertion, search, and deletion but it never maintained the track and order of insertion,
which the LinkedHashMap provides where the elements can be accessed in their insertion order.

Important Features of a LinkedHashMap are listed as follows:
- A LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key. It implements the Map interface and extends the HashMap class.
- It contains only unique elements.
- It may have one null key and multiple null values.
- It is non-synchronized.
- It is the same as HashMap with an additional feature that it maintains insertion order.
For example, when we run the code with a HashMap, we get a different order of elements.

Declaration:
public class LinkedHashMap<K,V> extends HashMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>
