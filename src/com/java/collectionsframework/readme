collections

collections is a group of objects as a single unit or entity

Collection Interface hierarchy
List Interface
    ArrayList
    LinkedList
    Vector
    Stack (it extents vector class)
    these are the concrete implementation of List Interface
Queue Interface
    PriorityQueue (is the most common implementation of Queue Interface)
    Deque (which extends Queue Interface)
    ArrayDeque (this implementation class which implements Deque Interface)
Set Interface
    HashSet
    LinkedHashSet
    these are the two implementation of Set Interface
 ->SortedSet (Interface - the purpose of sorting the elements in Ascending & descending order)
    TreeSet (we have the SortedSet implementation)


Map hierarchy

Map Interface (It has key-value pair)
    HashMap (Most commonly used class which implements Map Interface)
    LinkedHashMap
    Hashtable (legacy class hierarchy in collection framework hierarchy)
 ->SortedMap (Interface- the purpose of sorting is to sort the key-value pair)
    TreeMap (which Implements sorted Maps)

Object class
->Array (extends)
->Iterator (extends)

Collection Interface:
Collection Interface is the root Interface of Collection hierarchy
whenever we want to represent the group of individual objects as a single unit or entity then we can go for collection
It doesn't have direct implementation List, Set, Queue extends Collection Interface


Advantages of CollectionsFramework
- It reduce programming effort
- provides in-build methods & class
- Optimized & Highly performance
- Increase Productivity
- Reduce Operational time
- Interoperatability

Common methods

retain()
retainAll()

Common Exceptions in collection framework
Null PointerException - whenever your object is null or your null reference are having no reference
ClassCastException - whenever you covert a down casting
IllegalArgumentException - whenever you are going to pass invalid argument
IllegalStateException
UnSupportedOperationException - when particular collection cannot be modified
