HashSet
This class is used to store unique elements or unique values
- HashSet cannot contain duplicate values
- HashSet allows null value at once.
- HashSet is an unordered collection. It does not maintain the order in which the elements are inserted
- HashSet internally uses a HashMap to store its elements
- HashSet is not thread-safe. If multiple threads try to modify a HashSet at the same time, then the final outcome is not deterministic.
you must explicitly synchronize concurrent access to a HashSet in a multiple-threaded environment
